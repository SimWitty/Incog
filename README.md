What it is
==========

Incog provides a means to test for detecting and preventing covert channels. It can be used as a fire drill to evaluate an infrastructure's controls and a team's preparedness, without introducing malicious software into the environment.

What it is not
==============

Incog is not designed to be used for a penetration test or for facilitating a security breach. It does not evade anti-virus software, or otherwise conceal its actions. #incog is strictly meant for opening covert channels and testing defenses against said channels.
